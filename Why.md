### If you're here for travel insights and don't want to hear me ramble, skip this page :) 

My initial thought was to make this more of a website vibe - content, links to click, pictures, fin. However, I have too many thoughts to share so I suppose a blog really is more appropriate. 

Why did I want to do this? I have a few reasons... 
1. I have had an amazing time with my travels and wanted a place where other people could see my recommendations on what to do, see, and eat.
2. I want to remember everything - this blog is a step up from my notes app on my phone for memories and little details that I will inevitably forget.
3. I am a biomedical engineering PhD who wanted to learn how to utilize github.
4. People keep telling me that a "passion project" is a great way to use the time between defending my dissertation and starting my first job. By this, they usually mean some data analysis project on basketball shooting mechanics, baseball swing velocity, or whether running shoe design correlates with races run. I **LOVE** that type of stuff and dream of making a career out of it, but fresh out of a dissertation, more data analysis is not what my brain wants or needs. So, I decided to utilize github to make this blog as a type of happy medium. While it much more favors the creative side of the "passion project", it still improves my technical skills more than using a default template site would.
